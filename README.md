### Description:

Bookmarks is a Flask-based web application for saving and organizing links into folders. Built with Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, it offers the following features:

-   User Authentication: Create an account to log in.
-   Organized Structure: Add, edit, and delete folders and bookmarks.
-   Folder Management:
    Save bookmarks in new or existing folders, or leave them ungrouped.
    Empty folders can be added via the "Add Folder" button.
-   Sorting & Display:
    Bookmarks and folders are displayed in descending order of creation.
    Clicking a folder name filters its bookmarks.
    Ungrouped bookmarks ("None") are excluded from "My Folders."
-   Clean Link Display: URLs are displayed as their base links (e.g., https://www.google.com â†’ www.google.com).
-   Editing & Deletion:
    Update bookmark names/URLs and folder names.
    Deleting a folder removes its bookmarks.
-   Error Handling: Prevents user errors like empty fields, mismatched passwords, or duplicate usernames.

### Objective:

This web application lets you save your favorite websites in organized folders by creating an account. Your data is securely stored in a database, allowing you to access and visit your saved websites with a single click anytime.
